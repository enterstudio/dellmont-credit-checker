# dellmont-credit-checker
GNU/Linux program to notify if credit on one or more Dellmont/Finarea/Betamax voip provider accounts is running low. Once successfully tested it can be run as daily cron job with -q option and -m email_address option so that an email is generated when action to top up credit on the account is required. Can also run under MS Windows using Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/), or can be run as CGI job on Linux/Apache webserver.
